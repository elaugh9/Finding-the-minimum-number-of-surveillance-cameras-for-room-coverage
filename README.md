# Finding-the-minimum-number-of-surveillance-cameras-for-room-coverage
This is an optimization problem that takes the map of the room as an input and returns the locations of the cameras. The cameras need to cover all spots in the room with a minimum number of cameras. Our program takes as input a text file that represents the map of a  room as a grid. Using Best-first search algorithms (Greedy search &amp; A*) and Local search algorithms (Hill climbing &amp; Simulated annealing) to find the minimum number of cameras that covers all the cells.
